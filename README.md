<h2 align="center">Hi there 👋</h2>

<p align="center">
I’m Sirac Simsek, a full-stack engineer with a strong interest in applied machine learning and system design.<br/>
I build modern web applications, backend systems, and data-driven features with a focus on clarity, correctness, and long-term reliability.
</p>

<p align="center">
My background spans frontend development, backend architecture, and foundational machine learning concepts. I enjoy working close to both the user experience and the underlying system logic, understanding how design decisions, data flow, and infrastructure choices affect real-world behaviour.
</p>

<p align="center">
Alongside development, I enjoy exploring the theoretical side of computing. I document my thinking through longer technical write-ups and research-style investigations, covering topics such as information retrieval, numerical methods, and system behaviour. These projects help me strengthen fundamentals and approach engineering problems with more depth and structure.
</p>

<p align="center">
I’m currently focused on building production-grade systems, strengthening my machine learning foundations.
